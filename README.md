# 📈 Sales & Demand Forecasting for Businesses

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **machine learning-based sales forecasting system** using historical business data. By leveraging regression techniques, the system predicts future sales trends to help organizations:

- Optimize inventory  
- Estimate revenue  
- Make data-driven decisions  

**Internship:** Future Interns – Machine Learning  
**CIN ID:** FIT/JAN26/ML5215  
**Task:** Sales & Demand Forecasting (Task 1)  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze historical sales data to identify trends and seasonality  
- Build a robust forecasting model using the **Random Forest Regressor**  
- Evaluate performance by comparing actual vs. predicted values  
- Visualize actionable insights through **Matplotlib** and an interactive **Power BI dashboard**  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Data Science Stack:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Power BI  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 🔄 Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and formatted date columns  
2. **Feature Engineering:** Extracted time-based features (Month, Year) and aggregated sales  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized monthly patterns to identify peak seasons  
4. **Modeling:** Implemented a **Random Forest Regressor** to capture non-linear relationships in sales data  
5. **Forecasting:** Projected sales for upcoming months based on learned patterns  

---

## 📊 Key Visualizations
1. **Actual vs Predicted Sales**  
   Demonstrates how closely the model's predictions align with historical data  

2. **Future Sales Forecast**  
   Displays projected sales trends for the next period  

3. **Power BI Dashboard**  
   Interactive dashboard includes:  
   - Category-wise performance  
   - Regional sales distribution  
   - Time-slicers for deep-dive analysis  

---

## 💡 Business Insights
- **Seasonality:** Clear spikes observed in specific months (e.g., Year-end sales)  
- **Accuracy:** Model captures the general trend effectively, providing a reliable baseline for revenue estimation  
- **Recommendations:** Increase stock levels 1-2 months prior to identified peak periods to prevent stockouts
